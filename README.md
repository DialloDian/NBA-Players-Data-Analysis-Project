# NBA-Players-Data-Analysis-Project
This is a project I completed for my Business Intelligence Course. 

## Task
Researched and collected datasets containing 50,000+ rows of professional basketball players' stats worldwide. 
Cleaned dataset using Excel and selected NBA players’ stats during regular seasons from 1999 to 2020.
Analyzed 10 NBA players with more than five seasons of data and found unique patterns in player’s careers such as performance drop when players switch teams, drop in 6th season, then created graphs to visualize findings. 
Collaborated with a partner and wrote a comprehensive 40-plus page analysis report on findings.
